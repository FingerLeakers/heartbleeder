NAME
  heartbleeder - Test servers for OpenSSL CVE-2014-0160, aka Heartbleed
SYNOPSIS
  heartbleeder [options] host[:443]
DESCRIPTION
  heartbleeder is a tool that tests remotely (over a network) if a system is compromised by an insecure OpenSSL service, in accordance with CVE-2014-0160, aka Heartbleed.

  More about Heartbleed Bug can be viewed at http://heartbleed.com.
OPTIONS
  -hostfile=""  Path to a newline separated file with hosts or IPs.
  -listen="localhost:5000"  Address to serve HTTP dashboard from.
  -pg=false  Check PostgreSQL TLS. This option is incompatible with -hostfile.
  -refresh=10m0s  Seconds to wait before rechecking secure hosts.
  -retry=10s  Seconds to wait before retesting a host after an unfavorable response.
  -timeout=5s  Timeout after sending heartbeat.
  -workers=40  Number of workers to scan hosts with, only used with hostfile flag.
NOTES
  Multiple hosts may be monitored by setting '-hostfile' flag to a file with newline separated addresses. A web dashboard will be available at 'http://localhost:5000' by default.

  Postgres uses OpenSSL in a slightly different way. To test whether a Postgres server is vulnerable, run the following (defaults to port 5432). Example:

  $ heartbleeder -pg example.com.br
WARNING
  No guarantees are made about the accuracy of results, and you should verify them independently by checking your OpenSSL build.
